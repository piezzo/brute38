brute38
=======

BIP38 brute force password cracker, written in Go

Based on Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' implementation, but added features, bugs fixed,
and expanded with more command-line options and better support for variable-length passwords.

Latest additions are mostly statistics and ETA calculations.

See Charlie Hothersall-Thomas' original implementation  https://github.com/chigley/bip38 and Calin Culian's implementation which was the base for this fork at https://github.com/cculianu/brute38

Requires:

- Go Language

Installation/Compilation:

> go get

> go build

Running:

> ./brute38

The above assumes you have Go set up properly and you copied the code into your GOPATH/src somewhere.

If this got you access to your long-lost ridiculous wealth, you know how to reach me. 13MdozN4rwXUytuVB4Pb43VSaXkgHkQ7hj :)
